			artist-bio="After long years of experimenting with home recordings Gunes Akyurek decided to take the proper steps to make it happen and in 2013 with Salih Topuz camped in a container at a farm house out of the city and discussed about music, existence, cosmos and permaculture. After arranging the songs the duo rushed to the gates of Noisest, to seize Cagan Tunali and enjoy his wisdom. The team started to record the chosen four songs as a start. 

			The debut EP of the band 'Free Kids' includes four colorful tracks. Electric guitars, bass and vocals performed by Akyurek and drums by Topuz. Also Faruk Kavi contributed in the track Free Kids by creating flying guitar souls. The recording process was highly experimental in terms of combining old school recording technics with the new age DAW madness. Recording, mixing and mastering took nearly a year. Bass player Burak Serter and professional brain dancer and synth player Dogukan Acar joined the band and the band started sailing on vibrating air particles.

			The sound of PONZA is influenced by a wide range of genres including grunge, garage rock, surf rock and psychedelic vibes of any era. The band is now nurturing the infant songs for their first LP."
